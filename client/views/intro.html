            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>When I travel, I like to drench myself in the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of the area. I submit to local customs and crave regional food. After all, food defines a destination and connects people to the land and its cultural history. On my first trip to Kauaʻi, I longed for a book to help me plan a vacation steeped in local food. This is that book.</p>
            <p>Written by a foodie for foodies, “Tasting Kauaʻi: Restaurants” is an exclusive listing based on insider information. Since 2010, I have been writing professionally about the best farmers, produce, chefs, restaurants and food artisans on Kauaʻi. My husband, Daniel, is a professional photographer who works by my side. We’ve toured more than 90 farms and countless restaurant kitchens, while learning about the work that goes into the food we eat.</p>
            <p>I write about humble diners and food trucks that make fresh, affordable meals as well as tapas bars, swanky lounges and elite restaurants with sweeping views. As a full-time food writer, many people think of me as a food critic. But I like to call myself a food profiler. Instead of focusing on what’s wrong, I choose to focus on what’s right.</p>
            <p>I am a foodie at heart and read cookbooks for fun. I’ve been on food tours in the Rockies and learned how to make bread at Whole Foods through a workshop by Slow Food Denver. I’m a certified personal chef, a graduate of a 12-week organic farming course and a certified Hawai‘i Master Food Preserver. Our Kauai Food Tours are edible experiences designed for foodies like me, who want to connect deeply with the people and tastes of Kauaʻi.</p>
            <p>I’m an advocate for food that’s grown in a way that benefits everything on this planet. Not just the people who eat it, but the people who grow and harvest it. I also care about how farms affect the land, water and air as well as the wildlife that thrive in ecosystems created within diversified farms.</p>
            <p>When restaurants list local products on their menus, it means we eat food that’s extremely fresh and, therefore, more flavorful. It also supports our small community and reduces the island’s carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>The Garden Island is home to a lot of passionate cooks who make really good food. While Kauaʻi’s food can’t be compared to New York or Spain, our little paradise holds its own. It is my hope that people who support what we do, combined with the restaurants listed in our book, will bolster food security on Kauaʻi.</p>
            <p>After our first edition was released, residents told me they left our guidebook in their car for easy reference while running errands. Returning visitors said they used it daily and it never let them down. A Hawai‘i health educator even called to thank me for making healthy food options easy to find. Our “Tasting Kauai” app, which can be downloaded to smartphones and tables, makes it even easier to eat well on Kauaʻi!</p>
            <p>In essence, this book is about real food. Real. Fresh. Food.</p>
            <p>If you’re the kind of person who prefers making macaroni and cheese from scratch over grabbing a box off the shelf, then this is the book for you. If you prefer unique and sometimes funky environments, where the creativity of the chef spills into the dining area, then this is the book for you. If you’re partial to the predictability of chain restaurants, I hear they’re opening a national steak house on Kauaʻi soon. But don’t look for it in this book!</p>
